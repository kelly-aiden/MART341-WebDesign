        <p>
            Jupiter's moon Io is the most volcanically active world in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens of miles high. It's so cool that this comes from Io being caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's massive gravity and the smaller but precisely timed pulls from <element id = "moons">Europa and Ganymede</element>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As Jupiter rotates, it takes its magnetic field around with it, sweeping past Io and stripping off about <element id = "mass">1 ton</element> of Io's material every second.

            Io was discovered on Jan. 8, 1610 by Galileo. The discovery, along with the three other Jovian satellites, was the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than Earth. The discovery of the four Galilean satellites eventually led to the understanding that <element id = "sun">planets in our solar system orbit the Sun, instead of our solar system revolving around Earth.</element> So thanks for being noticeable IO!

            Io's surface temperature averages about <element id = "ice">-202 degrees F</element> which results in the formation of sulfur dioxide snowfields. But Io's volcanoes can reach <element id = "fire">3,000 degrees F,</element> which is why Io is often referred to as a celestial body of fire and ice.

            It even <element id = "lightning">creates lightning storms</element> on Jupiter! Io's orbit cuts across Jupiter's powerful magnetic lines of force, turning Io into an electric generator. According to NASA, Io can develop 400,000 volts across itself, in turn creating 3 million amperes of electrical current. This then makes its way back along Jupiter's magnetic field lines and causes lighting storms in Jupiter's upper atmosphere.
