        <p>
            Reason number 1: I'm in the cast!<br />
            That's right, I am one of the perormers in the cast so you would be supporting one of your students in their artistic passion. I and the rest of the cast and crew have put in an emmence amount of hard work and time into this production and the more people in attendance, the better. 
        </p>    

        <p>
            Reason number 2: It's going to be really good.<br />
            This is one of the most impressive shows I've ever seen in terms of set, props, lighting, and design. The performances are great to, put the crew and design team have done an extraordinary job creating a spectacular visual experience on the stage. And that was not cheap.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reason number 3: You'll be supporting the arts.<br />
            Supporting the arts is always a good thing. That's all. That's the whole point.
