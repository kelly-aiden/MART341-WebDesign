                <b>Peiter "Mudge" Zatko,</b> the former Twitter security executive, went to the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) in 2022 with some alleged Twitter security flaws. His disclosure outlined Twitter's vulnerabilities due to shady practices, such as extensive employee access to sensitive data, possible conflicts of interest with employees and foreign intelligence services, and a general disregard for security as a top priority. The Senate has released <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/dem/releases/senate-judiciary-committee-releases-testimony-of-twitter-whistleblower-peiter-mudge-zatko" target = "_blank">his exact testimony.</a>
            <p>
                With a long and prosperous career including influential roles in the Pentagon, Google, and advising lawmakers on cybersecurity, Zatko has always brought an integrity-first approach to addressing security concerns in both public and private sectors.

            <p>
                Twitter vehemently denies these allegations (what business would admit that they don’t have good security practices). However, Zatko has little to nothing to benefit from presenting false claims to the SEC. All being a whistleblower does is put one under public scrutiny and countless hours spent on the judicial/bureaucratic processes of such allegations. There is a possible monetary reward for a whistleblower, but that’s only if “high-quality original information leads to a Commission enforcement action in which over $1,000,000 in sanctions is ordered” (SEC). This means if the allegations were false, Zatko would receive nothing and would have his reputation ruined.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of Zatko’s reputation, his is phenomenal. According to CNN, before the Twitter case Zatko “led an influential cybersecurity grantmaking program at the Pentagon, worked at a Google division for developing cutting-edge technology, helped build the cybersecurity team at fintech firm Stripe, and advised US lawmakers and officials on how to plug security holes in the internet” (Lyngaas).

                Regarding the ethicality of Zatko’s actions, the good of the people and society should always outweigh any ethical concerns towards the company you are whistleblowing. Most, if not all large companies have strict rules regarding what you can and cannot share regarding security procedures. Thus, Zatko certainly broke some rules in the contract that he agreed to when he signed it. Ethically, breaking rules in your contract is bad…but if Zatko was in a place where he believed “It’s not an exaggeration that any employee could take over the accounts of any senator in this room,” (Guardian) it is more ethically corrupt to not report security concerns such as that.

            <p>
                Peiter Zatko is the kind of person needed in the realm of cyber security. He wants cyber security done the right way, and he is willing to put himself in the spotlight to do so.
