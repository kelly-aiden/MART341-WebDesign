                <b>The Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b> was entered into force in 2016 and serves as a way to protect the privacy of citizens in the EU. It applies to any organization so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU, and by 2018, those organizations were to be compliant with the GDPR's policies. On the very first day, an Austrian privacy campaigner by the name of Max Schrems wasted no time and lobbed a flurry of lawsuits at tech giants Facebook and Google. Lawsuits looking to yield fines as massive as $4.21 billion for Facebook and $3.99 billion for Google. Curious? Almost seems like Schrems had this plan locked and loaded and was waiting for the first second he could act on it.So let's breakdown why he did what he did and his ethical justifications for doing so.
            <p>
                Let's first talk about the GDPR's ethical stance. Within its rulebook is an article allowing people to the right to compensation for any kind of harm (financial or non-financial) resulting from a breach of the regulation. It's the GDPR's way of giving the people the power to stand up for their privacy and take action against privacy misconduct against them. So, it's all about holding those in charge of people's data accountable and giving individuals the power to seek justice.

                Schrems actions are exactly what the GDPR was made for, allowing regulators to fight for privacy rights. But some have may come to question the timing of this suits, Schrems didn't ven wait a day before filing them. It may look like a man taking advantage of the uncertainty of how these policies will be enforced; A man trying to sieze on an opportunity before these companies have had enough time to comply with these new regualtions. But that isn't the case at all, he's been waiting years for this moment.

                According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/86d1ce50-3799-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544">Financial Times</a>, "He had identified the specific flaw that Cambridge Analytica was able to exploit in 2011." referring to a flaw that allowed for 50 million users data to be sold for political purposes. Facebook cracked down on this in 2015, but that wasn't enough in his eyes. Schrems's gripes with Facbook's pricacy policies have existed for years, so it is no surprise that he pounced on them as soon as he got the proper chance to.

            <p>
                In regards to not giving the companies enough time, that may be a valid point if it were a small tech company who was only given a few months to make sufficient changes. But that is simply not the case. He is filing suits against two of the largest tech companies in the world with plenty of resources to make the changes needed. As well the GDPR was passed in 2016 and it wouldn't be another two years until companies were enforced to comply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google and Facebook are defending themselves, claiming that the changes to their policies they've made are sufficient enough for the GDPR. Schrems oppposes that and is specifically targeting "the way companies obtain consent for the privacy policies" according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/25/17393766/facebook-google-gdpr-lawsuit-max-schrems-europe">The Verge</a>. If the companies' claims of being adequitly prepared are correct, then they have nothing to worry about. Wasting resources on legal trouble is also hardly a concern for these multi-billion dollar companies. It would be far more costly for Schrems to be going into this hastly and without proper preparation then it would be for the companies spending resources on legal fees if Schrems were to lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the day any criticism that could be lofted towards Schrems is thwarted by what appears to be Schrems true intentions, to ensure data privacy for everybody. If this case were to win, it would set a precident for people to not hesitate when they see privacy injustice and to utilize the new, powerful tool that is the GDPR. These large corperations have infinetly more power than any one, two, or even a hundred people. It is nice to see a thing like the GDPR that can be used, like in Schrems case, as a means for the people to not let these massive companies mistreat our privacy.
