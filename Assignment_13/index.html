            So you want to solve that mixed up Rubik's Cube that's been sitting at home all these years? Or you just think messing around with a Rubik's Cube looks like fun. This site will teach you the easiest way to solve a cube and some other more advanced ways if you want to get more serious with cubing as a hobby. As well as providing a link to get some pretty rad cubes. Let's first establish some basic terminology before getting started:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <img src="./media/holding-a-cube.jpg" alt="Example of holding a cube">
            <b>1. Orientation</b><br/>
            When holding a cube, hold it as seen in the picture. With one face of the cube towards you and a hand on either side.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>2. Pieces </b><br/>
            There are three types of pieces:<br/> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                     Centers - these remain fixed and serve as a guideline to solve the puzzle. On a solved cube, all the pieces of a particular color surround the centre of that color. On a scrambled cube, the centre represents the side on which the pieces of a particular color are supposed to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corners - As the name suggests, the corner pieces are located on the corners of the cube. Each piece is made up of three different colors. There are 8 corners on any cube shape, and thus there are 8 corners on the Rubik's cube.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Edges - The edges are the pieces between two corners. They are made up of two colors. There are 12 edges on the Rubik's cube. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>3. Notation</b><br/>
            The [] will notate the movement of the layer from the natural holding position for a better understanding:<br/> 
            <ul>
                <li>R - Right side clockwise [Right side upwards]</li>
                <li>R’ - Right side counter-clockwise [Right side downwards]</li>
                <li>L -  Left side clockwise [Left side downwards]</li>
                <li>L’ - Left side counter-clockwise [Left side upwards] (Note: L and R may be confusing at first since the moves are opposite to each other)</li>
                <li>F - Front side clockwise</li>
                <li>F’ - Front side counter-clockwise</li>
                <li>B - Back side clockwise</li>
                <li>B’ - Back side counter-clockwise</li>
                <li>U - Upper side clockwise</li>
                <li>U’ - Upper side counter-clockwise</li>
                <li>D - Downward/Bottom/Lower side clockwise</li>
                <li>D’ - Downward/Bottom/Lower side counter-clockwise</li>
                <li>Any letter followed by a 2 (U2, L2, etc.) means to turn that side twice. Thus direction does not matter as either way twice will result in the same move</li>
            </ul>
