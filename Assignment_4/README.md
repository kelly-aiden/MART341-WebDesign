#Answers for Assignment 4
1. The UI (user interface) is what users are shown and is how they interact with the contents and features of the site. The rendering engine is what creates the visuals of the page from information given from html and css pages. The browser engine communicates between the UI, rendering engine, and outside servers. The network is how all the different components interact with one another. A coding language interpreter is needed to understand the coding language behind the functionality of the site. Every site also has data storage of some kind.

2. DOM is a Document Object Model. It is an interface to a document and stipulates how that document is accessed and changed by defining its structure in a logical way. It does this by structuring each item as a node in a tree structure so it can be easily identified and ordered by the rendering engine and easily modified by a coding language.

3. HTML is the base for most websites as it displays document nodes, dictating a pages structure and contents. XML doesn't display the nodes directly, it describes them so you are able to update a page with new info without having to refresh the page. XHTML has strict standards which makes it more time consuming to write but in turn corrects many of HTML's flaws, especially those that translate to mobile devices.

4. In order, your html page needs: The Document type, the root element, the head element, and the body element.

5. The index page is your homepage and is automatically looked for by a browser when a page is loaded. It is the first page in your html code.

6. Root folder will contain all the contents of the site, and only the contents related to the site itself. Must always have an index.html page as your homepage. No spaces or "funky" characters when naming files or folders; only use dashes, underscores, lower and upper case letters, and numbers. Try to not start names with numbers. Keep naming conventions consistent. Try to have some folders that only contain specific types of data: pages folder, images folder, css folder, etc.
