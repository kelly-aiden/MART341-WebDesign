# **My Heading**
Here is an example of my first paragraph. It may be quite short. But, that is the beauty of just having to make some examples of markdown elements.

Now that there was an empty space between the last sentence, this is the beginnning of a **new paragraph!** 

### Subheading
I can even do subheadings that are a little smaller than the main heading. As well, I can make _lists_.

Here's a list of some fruits:
- Rasberry
- Banana
- Kiwi
- Pineapple
